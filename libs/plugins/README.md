## Plugins
You need Vault or ShopChest disables itself. All other plugins are not needed, but will extend the functionality of ShopChest. LWC or Lockette is recommended, but do not install both of them, as it may lead to errors. If you already have a plugin installed on your server, you don't need to do download it.
