# Plugins
A list of plugins, which are either required, recommended or just compatible with ShopChest.

## Vault
Vault is required to run ShopChest.
It adds the economy system, but you need to have a supported economy system installed.

## LWC
LWC is a protection plugin.
It's not required, but it's recommended to protect shops from hoppers, etc.

## Lockette
Lockette is also a protection plugin.
It does basically the same as LWC, just in another way.
Do **not** install LWC **and** Lockette at the same time, as it may lead to errors.

## ClearLag
ClearLag is a plugin, which is not required.
With it you can remove all entities manually or in a specific interval.
I added it here to the list, because ShopChest supports it. That means, the shop items won't get removed with it. *(Actually they will, but they get reloaded afterwards).*
